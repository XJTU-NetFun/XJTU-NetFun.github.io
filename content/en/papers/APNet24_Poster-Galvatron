    "This paper introduces Galvatron, a domain-specific language designed to simplify transport layer programming. Galvatron obscures the underlying data structures and operations, and exposes parametric processing stages to the developer, thus significantly reducing coding effort. Our evaluation demonstrate Galvatron’s ability to encapsulate complex semantics of 4 real-world transport protocols using merely 2% of the code compared to native implementations."
